DAQ seems to work up to:
div = 128:  2GHz --> 75kHz DAQ
div = 64:   4GHz --> 112kHz (already artefacts visible)
div = 32:   8HGz --> 123kHz (Intensities are off a lot)
div = 16:   16Ghz --> no signal detected. Could be useful if chip is supplied with 5V, which increases its max clock rate.

changed data acquistion to bcm2835.h library (by Mike McCauley: http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835)
optimisiation --> optimise data acquisition for the mcp3201 IC: transfer many double-bytes of data at once. each acquisition needs a pulldown of CS pin (which could also set the DAQ rate).


screen buffer can now be drawn by single command due to c-string structure:
xxxxx\n
xxxxx\n
xxxxx\n
xxxxx\n
\0

pi_screen:
add dataInputBuffer to pi_screen to reduce syncing problem (slowly fill dataInputBuffer and then memcopy it into dataBuffer in one step).
decided to use fixed size data Buffers in (according to the amount of pixels to be displayed). They should be binned to the "correct" time axis on the long run.
